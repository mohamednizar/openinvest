there may be some user ad on this system

It has many branches and every branches has same structure 

I use a simple scenario to explain how the system has to be....

I an invest wants to publish bis/her business idea he has to be perform following process
1. Creating an account and verify it with valid ID card(the verification done by BA team)
2. Draft the Business Plane and sharp it on the forum,in the forum BA and well wisher can give suggestions and ideas to improve it.
3. Rate the Business Plane (the system has to rate the business plane with help of procedures given on)the will provide general formate of business plane 
4. Investors can select and start with selected authors of business plane,once the investors endorse the idea he can invest on it
5. From the back end investment coordinator handle the all,the business has register as a child company of openinvest (this is the where we earn profit)
6. The Our web site has to update all our business situations and achievement on business forum
This is a ruff idea and I encourage less and add ideas from contributors .
